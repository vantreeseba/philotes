# Multi-Tenant Plan

## Overview

Each tenant = one user. Persons are a shared global registry. Everything a
user *creates or tracks* about a person is private to that user.

---

## Conceptual Model

```
users (new)
  └── user_persons (new — "I track this person" + my personal context)
        └── persons (shared — identity only: name, email)

notes          ─┐
activities      │
interactions    │  all get userId added → only visible to owner
tasks           │
labels          │
personLabels    │
importantDates  │
personRelations─┘

addresses     ─┐  user-specific: different users may have different
contactInfos  ─┘  contact details on file for the same person
```

---

## Phase 1: Database Schema

### 1.1 Add `users` table
New file `db/src/models/users.ts`:
- `id` uuid PK
- `email` text unique not null
- `name` text not null
- `passwordHash` text not null
- `createdAt` / `updatedAt` timestamps

### 1.2 Add `user_persons` table
New file `db/src/models/user-persons.ts`.  
This is both the "I track this person" claim and the home for fields that
are personal context (not global facts):
- `userId` uuid FK → users.id (ON DELETE CASCADE) — part of composite PK
- `personId` uuid FK → persons.id (ON DELETE CASCADE) — part of composite PK
- `contactFrequency` (moved from `persons`)
- `howWeMet` (moved from `persons`)
- `firstMetDate` (moved from `persons`)
- `avatarPath` (moved from `persons`)
- `createdAt`

### 1.3 Slim down `persons`
Remove from `persons`: `contactFrequency`, `howWeMet`, `firstMetDate`,
`avatarPath`. Keep: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `createdAt`,
`updatedAt`. The email uniqueness constraint stays — persons are a global
registry and email is the dedup key.

### 1.4 Add `userId` to all user-owned tables
Add `userId uuid NOT NULL FK → users.id` to each of:
- `notes`
- `activities`
- `interactions`
- `tasks`
- `labels`
- `importantDates`
- `personRelationships`
- `addresses`
- `contactInfos`

For `personLabels`: change the composite PK to `(personId, labelId, userId)`
and add `userId FK → users.id`. This way two users can independently tag the
same person with labels from their own label sets.

> **Tradeoff — addresses / contactInfos:** These could be shared facts about
> a person (one canonical phone number). We're making them user-specific
> because different users may have different/outdated info, and it avoids the
> surprising UX of one user's edit changing another user's view. Revisit if
> "verified shared contact info" becomes a feature request.

### 1.5 Generate and run migrations
```
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```
Update `db/src/relations.ts` to reflect all new FKs and the `user_persons`
join table.

---

## Phase 2: Auth Layer

### 2.1 Install dependencies
In `server/`:
- `bcryptjs` + `@types/bcryptjs`
- `jsonwebtoken` + `@types/jsonwebtoken`

### 2.2 Add `register` and `login` mutations
New file `server/src/resolvers/auth.ts` following the existing extension
pattern (`applyAuthExtension`):

```graphql
type AuthPayload {
  token: String!
  userId: ID!
}

extend type Mutation {
  register(email: String!, name: String!, password: String!): AuthPayload!
  login(email: String!, password: String!): AuthPayload!
}
```

- `register`: bcrypt-hash password, insert user, return JWT
- `login`: look up user by email, bcrypt-compare, return JWT
- JWT payload: `{ userId }`, signed with `JWT_SECRET` env var, expires in 30 days

### 2.3 Inject `userId` into GraphQL context
Update `server/src/routes/graphql.ts`:

```ts
export interface Context {
  db: DB;
  userId: string | null;
}
```

In the `context` function, read `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from the
request headers, verify the JWT, and set `userId`. Unauthenticated requests
get `userId: null` (public queries like `login`/`register` still work).

### 2.4 Add a `requireAuth` helper
Small utility in `server/src/resolvers/auth.ts`:
```ts
function requireAuth(ctx: Context): string {
  if (!ctx.userId) throw new GraphQLError("Unauthenticated", { ... });
  return ctx.userId;
}
```
All user-scoped resolvers call this first.

---

## Phase 3: Resolver Enforcement

This is the bulk of the work. `drizzle-graphql` auto-generates resolvers that
are unaware of `userId`. We override them with custom extensions.

### 3.1 Create a `withUser` query helper
New file `server/src/resolvers/user-scope.ts`:
A small wrapper that appends `eq(table.userId, userId)` to any drizzle `where`
clause. Keeps the per-table extension files thin.

### 3.2 Write custom extensions for user-scoped tables
One file per table, following the existing `applyXxxExtension` pattern.
Each extension:
- Replaces the auto-generated list/single queries with versions that filter
  `WHERE userId = ?`
- Replaces create mutations to inject `userId` from context (caller cannot
  override it)
- Replaces update/delete mutations to add `AND userId = ?` so users can only
  touch their own rows

Tables needing extensions:
- `notes` (+ noteTags, noteMentions — inherit via note ownership)
- `activities` (+ activityTags)
- `interactions` (+ interactionTags)
- `tasks`
- `labels` (+ personLabels — label queries scoped to userId)
- `importantDates` (+ importantDateTags)
- `personRelationships`
- `addresses`
- `contactInfos`

### 3.3 Update the `persons` resolver
Persons are shared but a user only sees persons they've added to their CRM
(i.e., have a `user_persons` row for). The `persons` list query becomes:
```sql
SELECT p.* FROM persons p
JOIN user_persons up ON up.person_id = p.id
WHERE up.user_id = ?
```
Single `person` query adds the same join as an existence check.

### 3.4 Add `user_persons` resolvers
- `addPersonToMyContacts(personId)` — creates a `user_persons` row
- `updateMyPersonContext(personId, { contactFrequency, howWeMet, ... })` — updates user-specific fields
- `removePersonFromMyContacts(personId)` — deletes the `user_persons` row

---

## Phase 4: Frontend

### 4.1 Add Apollo auth link
In the Apollo Client setup, add an `authLink` that reads the JWT from
`localStorage` and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### 4.2 Login / Register pages
New routes:
- `/login` — email + password form, calls `login` mutation, stores token
- `/register` — email + name + password form, calls `register` mutation

### 4.3 Auth gate
In `__root.tsx`, check for a JWT. If absent, redirect to `/login`. On 401
GraphQL errors, clear the token and redirect to `/login`.

### 4.4 Update person detail / create pages
- Person create: after creating the person, auto-create the `user_persons` row
- Person detail: show the `user_persons` fields (contactFrequency, howWeMet,
  etc.) in a separate "My context" section, editable independently of the
  shared person identity fields

### 4.5 Run codegen
```
npm run codegen
```
After all schema and resolver changes are done.

---

## What Stays the Same

- `persons` remains the dedup key (email unique). If user A adds
  `alice@example.com` and user B adds `alice@example.com` later, they both
  point at the same person row but each have their own `user_persons` context
  and their own notes/interactions/etc.
- The existing `drizzle-graphql` auto-generation still builds the base schema.
  Custom extensions layer on top, same as today.
- PGlite stays as-is — no changes to the DB engine.
- The existing extension pattern (`applyXxxExtension`) is reused throughout.

---

## Open Questions (decide before starting Phase 3)

1. **Shared persons discovery:** Can a user search all persons in the global
   registry (even ones they haven't added) and then "add" them? Or can they
   only see persons they've added? The plan above allows global search +
   add-to-contacts as the flow.

2. **Email as dedup key:** Currently `persons.email` is unique. Is that still
   the right dedup key for a shared registry, or do we want to allow multiple
   persons with the same email and resolve conflicts differently?

3. **Person creation:** When user A creates a new person, we create a `persons`
   row + a `user_persons` row in the same operation. What happens when user B
   imports the same person by email? We detect the duplicate by email and just
   create a `user_persons` row pointing at the existing person.

4. **Existing data migration:** For any existing single-user data, we'll need a
   migration that creates a default "seed" user and assigns all existing rows
   to that user.
